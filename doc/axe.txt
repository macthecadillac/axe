*axe*

A configurable plugin to execute external commands in the built-in terminal
based on file type.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Commands

*Axe*           - `Axe {cmd}` where `cmd` is the sub-command you defined
                (see |g:axe#cmds| below). This will execute the
                command you configured.
*AxeList*       - List all the defined sub-commands available for the current
                file type
*AxeProcs*      - List all background processes launched through |Axe|
                (those that run not in the terminal but in the background)
*AxeStop*       - Terminate process with the provided process number.
                `Axe {#}` where `#` is the process number listed by
                |AxeListProcs|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Configurations

Configurations could be global or local. Global configurations reside in your
`init.vim` whereas local configurations are located in `.axe.vim` in
your local directory, either in the same folder as the file to be edited or in
the root of the `git` repository. Local configurations, if found, always have
precedence over global configurations. The configuration options that are
covered in the following are applicable to both global and local
configurations.


g:axe#cmds                                                        *g:axe#cmds*

  This is a |dictionary| that maps |Axe| sub-commands to shell commands. The
  dictionary must contain keys (as |string|'s) that are vim |filetype|'s. The
  value of the each entry is another |dictionary| that contains the following
  four entries:
  
    `cmd`              |string| The command to be invoked
    `with_filename`    |boolean| Supply the command with the file name (append
                     to the command) if set to 1, run the command without the
                     file name if set to 0. (Default is 1)
    `in_term`          |boolean| Run the command in the terminal if set to 1, run
                     in the background if set to 0. (Default is 0)
    `exe_in_proj_root` |boolean| Execute in the root of the project where the
                     .git directory is found. (Default is 0)
  
  Of the four entries, `cmd` is mandatory (for obvious reasons). The other
  three are optional. When they are not specified, the default values are used
  (see above). These global defaults could be overridden either as a global
  option or on a per filetype basis. See |g:axe#filetype_defaults|,
  |g:axe#with_filename|, |g:axe#in_term| and |g:axe#exe_in_proj_root|.
  
  Instead of being specific file types, the first level keys could optionally
  be a wildcard, in this case `'*'` that serves as a catch-all and the command
  will henceforth be defined for all file types. Notice that file type
  specific commands will override catch-all commands if conflicts arise.
  
  Example: >
  
    let g:axe#cmds = {
          \ '*': {
          \     'update-ctags': {
          \       'cmd': 'ctags -R -h --exclude={.git}',
          \       'with_filename': 0,
          \     },
          \   },
          \ 'python': {
          \     'run': {
          \       'cmd': '$HOME/anaconda3/bin/python',
          \       'in_term': 1
          \     },
          \     'background-run': {'cmd': '$HOME/anaconda3/bin/python'},
          \   },
          \ 'tex': {
          \     'build': {
          \       'cmd': 'latexmk -silent',
          \       'in_term': 1
          \     },
          \     'continuous-build': {'cmd': 'latexmk -pvc -interaction=nonstopmode'},
          \   },
          \ 'rust': {
          \     'run': {'cmd': 'cargo run', 'with_filename': 0, 'in_term': 1},
          \     'quick-build': {
          \       'cmd': 'cargo build',
          \       'with_filename': 0,
          \       'in_term': 1
          \     },
          \     'release-build': {
          \       'cmd': 'cargo build --release',
          \       'in_term': 1
          \     },
          \   },
          \ }

g:axe#filetype_defaults                              *g:axe#filetype_defaults*

  Type: |dictionary|
  Default: `{}`

  This option sets the behavior of the executor on a per filetype basis. The
  dictionary could have the following keys:

  `with_filename`    |boolean| Supply the command with the file name (append
                   to the command) if set to 1, run the command without the
                   file name if set to 0.
  `in_term`          |boolean| Run the command in the terminal if set to 1, run
                   in the background if set to 0.
  `exe_in_proj_root` |boolean| Execute in the root of the project where the
                   .git directory is found.

  Example: >
  
      let g:axe#filetype_defaults = {
        \ 'rust': {'with_filename': 0},
        \ }
  <


g:axe#with_filename                                      *g:axe#with_filename*

  Whether the name of the file currently in buffer should be appended to the
  command being run.


g:axe#in_term                                                  *g:axe#in_term*

  Type: |string|
  Default: `'down'`
  
  For terminal commands, this option determines the direction in which the
  terminal split should be opened. Available options are `'up'`, `'down'`,
  `'left'`, `'right'`.

  Type: |string|
  Default: `'\n-------------------------\nPress ENTER to exit'`

  This option sets the text to be printed to the terminal at the termination
  of a terminal command.

  Type: |integer|
  Default: `15`

  For terminal commands, this option sets the height of the terminal split (if
  |g:axe#split_direction| is set to `'up'` or `'down'`).


g:axe#term_width                                            *g:axe#term_width*
